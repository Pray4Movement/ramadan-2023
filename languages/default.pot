"\"I am twenty-four and from Tunisia. I had a lot of debt and owed a lot of people and the government money. I asked myself, \"Why don't I ask God to help me?\" The truth is, I didn't ask because I didn't believe God would help me. I left Islam and called myself an atheist. But, there was always something inside me that said, \"There is a God.\" I began to search and discuss with my friends. At that time, all of us were disillusioned, searching for truth, and some had even become Christians. We all brought information and shared with one another. Pray for us that we will discover truth together.\"\n"

"When attempts are made to mistreat believers [in location] - and even when some must flee - may they be blessed with the boldness and perseverance to continue to preach the gospel. (Acts 14:5-7) Lord, give them faith that persecution cannot shake."

"Testimony from Senegal.\n"
"\"Jane\" found herself pregnant as a teenager and so somehow gave her self an abortion.  A few years later, she was pregnant again.  This time she decided to keep the baby, but in order to avoid shaming the family, her parents forced her to abort.  She was 5 months along, and the baby was born alive.  Her mother showed her the baby, and then buried it alive.  And Jane lived in the grief and anger and bitterness that followed this event.\n"
