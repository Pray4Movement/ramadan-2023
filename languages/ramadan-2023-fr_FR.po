"\"I am twenty-four and from Tunisia. I had a lot of debt and owed a lot of "
"people and the government money. I asked myself, \"Why don't I ask God to "
"help me?\" The truth is, I didn't ask because I didn't believe God would "
"help me. I left Islam and called myself an atheist. But, there was always "
"something inside me that said, \"There is a God.\" I began to search and "
"discuss with my friends. At that time, all of us were disillusioned, "
"searching for truth, and some had even become Christians. We all brought "
"information and shared with one another. Pray for us that we will discover "
"truth together.\"\n"
"\n"
"Pray for spiritual seekers [in X] and all over the Muslim world to search "
"and discuss the Bible with friends."
